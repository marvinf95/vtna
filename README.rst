vtna
====

vtna is short for Visualize Temporal Networks using Attributes.
Its main purpose is to support the `vtna_frontend <https://github.com/marvinf95/vtna_frontend>`_ Jupyter notebook.

vtna contains utilities for

* importing temporal network data and metadata as found on `sociopatterns.org <http://www.sociopatterns.org/>`_ (vtna.data_import and vtna.graph)
* computing layouts for temporal networks (vtna.layout)
* centrality measures for nodes in a global and local temporal context (vtna.node_measure)
* filtering nodes based on attributes (vtna.filter)
* transforming temporal graphs to networkx graphs (vtna.utility)
